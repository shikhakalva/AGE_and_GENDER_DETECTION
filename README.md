Age and Gender Detection

This repository contains code for an age and gender detection system using computer vision techniques and Python deep learning models. The system detects the approximate age and gender of faces in images or video streams. The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on publicly available datasets and leverages OpenCV for face detection and image preprocessing. The implementation is based on Python and utilizes popular deep-learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras. Users can easily integrate the provided scripts into their projects for age and gender estimation tasks.
